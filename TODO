Appendable allocs:

Done:

* Store appendability, finalizability flags in slabData space for both slab and large allocs
* Store actual alloc length and finalizer, if applicable, in slabData space (for large allocs) or in tail of suitably enlarged block (for slab allocs)

Remaining:

* Predicate returning whether an alloc is appendable.
* Function to read avail. space in appendable alloc.
* Function to append (or reduce) an appendable alloc.
* Preserve metadata (from both slab and large allocs) during realloc()
* Actually invoke the finalizer, if present, during free()
* Tests.
